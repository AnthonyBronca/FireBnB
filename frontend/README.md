## Set Up

1. Install packages: `npm install`
2. Start the server:

There are 2 ways the run the server with Vite. We can either run it in dev mode, or in production mode.
- To run it in production mode we can run: `npm start`

Note: You may need to build first by running: `npm run build`

- To run it in dev mode, run: `npm run dev`

Assuming the API in the backend is running and working smoothly, you should be all set!
